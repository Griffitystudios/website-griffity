# React vs Next.js: Which We Prefer for Building Modern Web Apps  

In today‚Äôs fast-paced tech world, choosing the right framework can define the success of your web project. Two of the most popular tools for frontend development‚Äî**React** and **Next.js**‚Äîboth deliver incredible performance and flexibility.  

At **Griffity Studios**, known as the **best IT company in Nepal**, we use both React and Next.js to craft modern, scalable web applications. But depending on your goals, one might be better suited than the other. Let‚Äôs explore why.

##  React: The Frontend Powerhouse  

React is a **JavaScript library** developed by Meta (Facebook) that makes it easy to build dynamic and interactive user interfaces.  

###  Advantages of React  
- **Reusable Components:** Simplifies UI development and maintenance.  
- **Strong Ecosystem:** Thousands of community-built libraries and tools.  
- **Ideal for SPAs:** Excellent for single-page apps and dashboards.  

###  Limitations of React  
- **No Built-in Routing:** Requires React Router or similar tools.  
- **No Server-Side Rendering (SSR):** Can limit SEO performance.  
- **Setup Complexity:** Needs manual configuration for SEO, caching, and optimization.  

---

##  Next.js: The Full-Stack Framework  

Next.js builds on React‚Äôs foundation but adds everything developers need for **production-ready performance**. It‚Äôs a complete framework that supports rendering, routing, and backend APIs right out of the box.  

###  Advantages of Next.js  
- **SEO-Friendly:** Server-Side Rendering (SSR) and Static Site Generation (SSG) boost visibility.  
- **Faster Load Times:** Code splitting and image optimization are automatic.  
- **Built-in API Routes:** Simplifies backend integration.  
- **Hybrid Rendering:** Mix CSR, SSR, and SSG as needed for your project.  

###  Limitations of Next.js  
- Slightly steeper learning curve for beginners.  
- Requires hosting environments that support SSR (e.g., Vercel, custom servers).

##  Our Preference at Griffity Studios  

When building **large-scale, modern web apps** for startups or enterprises, we typically choose **Next.js**. It provides faster performance, better SEO, and a smoother developer experience.  

However, for lightweight internal tools or dashboards, **React alone** remains a great choice‚Äîespecially when speed of development and flexibility are priorities.

##  Conclusion  

Whether you choose React or Next.js, the key lies in **matching the tool to your goals**. If you want fast, SEO-optimized, and scalable web apps, **Next.js is the future**.  

At **Griffity Studios**, the **best IT company in Nepal**, our developers build custom solutions using both React and Next.js‚Äîbalancing performance, design, and functionality.
